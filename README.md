Thank you for your interest in my research into Artificial Intelligence, Machine and Deep Learning.

I have worked in Information Technology since 1975 (nearly 50 years ago now!) when I built my first computer. Through those 50 years I've built computers from discrete transistors all they way to tiny Internet of Things (IoT) machines to massively parallel GPUs occupying entire rooms. Along the way I've taught more than 600 people of all walks of life financial freedom, technological prowess and how to have just plain fun with all of this.
